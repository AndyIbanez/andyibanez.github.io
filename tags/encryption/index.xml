Apple provides us with many tools to make encryption easy, like &lt;a href="https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/common-cryptographic-operations-with-cryptokit/">CryptoKit&lt;/a>, a high-level Cryptography framework on iOS. When &lt;a href="https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/cryptokit-not-enough/">CryptoKit is not enough&lt;/a>, we can leverage older, lower-level APIs to do more cryptographic operations or use cyphers not covered by CryptoKit. We can even make use of &lt;a href="https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/cryptokit-secure-enclave/">the Secure Enclave&lt;/a> to leverage hardware-level security to our apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is all cool and dandy but did you know that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to leverage any of the technologies above to secure data in your app? In this article we will provide a much simpler method to protect user data, without having to know the first thing about Cryptography at all, and without compromising security at all. If you know you need to protect data, you can consider this option before even considering directly dealing with cryptography at all.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
