&lt;p>Every year, at WWDC, Apple gives us a lot of new things to play around with. For the big new things, they prepare session videos and labs so developers can experiment with the new technologies and hopefully integrate them in their apps by the time the new OSes are out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;big things&amp;rdquo; are one thing, but Apple introduces &lt;em>a bunch&lt;/em> of new APIs every year. Many (oh boy, &lt;strong>many&lt;/strong>) of them do not get any coverage at WWDC at all. Not in a session, and sometimes not even a small mention of them anywhere.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Modern Swift Concurrency Summary, Cheatsheet, and Thanks</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/modern-swift-concurrency-summary-cheatsheet-thanks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/modern-swift-concurrency-summary-cheatsheet-thanks/</guid><description>&lt;h6 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents&lt;/h6>

&lt;p>Since WWDC21, we have talked, extensively, about all the new concurrency features introduced in Swift 5.5. We covered &lt;em>a lot&lt;/em> of topics, so I decided to finish off this series writing a summary article were we cover the most important topics of each article.

&lt;p>Along the new concurrency APIs introduced in Swift at WWDC2021, we have AsyncSequence. &lt;code>AsyncSequence&lt;/code> is a collection protocol that allow us to receive data in loops and even top higher order functions - such as &lt;code>filter&lt;/code>, &lt;code>map&lt;/code> and &lt;code>reduce&lt;/code> - asynchronously, being able to &lt;code>await&lt;/code> for new data as it becomes available.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sharing Data Across Tasks with the @TaskLocal property wrapper in the new Swift Concurrency Model</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/sharing-data-across-tasks-tasklocal-new-swift-concurrency-model/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/sharing-data-across-tasks-tasklocal-new-swift-concurrency-model/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This article is part of my &lt;a href="https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/modern-concurrency-in-swift-introduction/">Modern Concurrency in Swift Article Series&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When we are working with concurrency, the most common problem developers face are data races. Whether it is a task updating a value at the same time another task is reading it or two tasks writing a value so that it it has an invalid value, data races are probably the main pain point of concurrency. Data races are very easy create, and hard to debug. There are entire books dedicated to the problem of data races and established patterns to avoid them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unstructured Concurrency With Detached Tasks in Swift</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/unstructured-concurrency-with-detached-tasks-in-swift/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/unstructured-concurrency-with-detached-tasks-in-swift/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This article is part of my &lt;a href="https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/modern-concurrency-in-swift-introduction/">Modern Concurrency in Swift Article Series&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Before you try to dive in with concurrency in Swift, you need to understand async/await. There&amp;rsquo;s no way around it. While async/await are not the only &lt;a href="https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/multithreading-options-on-apple-platforms/">concurrency options&lt;/a>, Apple&amp;rsquo;s SDKs are starting to make heavy use of them. There is no doubt that third-party library providers will start offering these as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Modern Concurrency in Swift: Introduction</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/modern-concurrency-in-swift-introduction/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jun 2021 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/modern-concurrency-in-swift-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>This is a tutorial series focused on the new async/await APIs Apple introduced in WWDC2021.

In fact, in my day job, in which I maintain a user-facing banking app, the vast majority of users are not even in the latest version. The most used version is the one we released in April, and we average one release per week for bug fixes alone, and about monthly for major new features.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Integrating FaceID/TouchID with SwiftUI</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/integrating-face-id-touch-id-swiftui/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 May 2021 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/integrating-face-id-touch-id-swiftui/</guid><description>&lt;p>As SwiftUI is still relatively new, and it is not clear yet for many people how to use MVVM on iOS, I decided to write this short article in which I explain how one would integrate Face ID/Touch ID with SwiftUI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s remember that SwiftUI uses the MVVM design pattern over the traditional MVC, and this can be confusing for people who are migrating to the new pattern for the first time. That said, the main takeaway from this article is to understand that views get destroyed and rebuilt &lt;em>very&lt;/em> often in SwiftUI, and therefore the right place to write this kind of logic is in the &lt;code>ViewModel&lt;/code>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using NSMeasurement For Working with Dimensions and Units</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/using-nsmeasurement-for-working-with-dimensions-and-units/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/using-nsmeasurement-for-working-with-dimensions-and-units/</guid><description>&lt;p>Software development can be an easy thing, as it can be a very complex thing. And one of those complex things is keeping in mind all the different languages, locations, and standards users may use in their daily lives. This makes working with certain information. From different date formats to entirely different measuring system, software is challenging, especially when working with anything that requires localization. The situation is just so bad that a lot of software just make assumptions about their users environment and don&amp;rsquo;t let you change any settings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using CoreLocation With SwiftUI</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/using-corelocation-with-swiftui/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Mar 2021 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/using-corelocation-with-swiftui/</guid><description>&lt;p>SwiftUI forces us to change our way of thinking when building iOS apps. It makes us change from writing our apps in MVC to MVVM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, we will explore how SwiftUI can be used with certain frameworks that aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;SwiftUI ready&amp;rdquo;. While this article uses CoreLocation as an example, keep in mind that you can use what you learn from this to integrate almost any other framework with SwiftUI, whether it is provided by Apple or not.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting to Know the Simulator Better</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/getting-to-know-the-simulator-better/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/getting-to-know-the-simulator-better/</guid><description>&lt;p>Every iOS developer has used the simulator. Alongside Xcode, it&amp;rsquo;s probably one of the most used tool by us all. We use the simulator to test our iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS apps without having to run them in an iOS device.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But other than helping us test our apps, the simulator actually has many nice features that can help make our job a little bit easier. With the use of these features we can avoid using physical devices until it&amp;rsquo;s time to do an actual test run or one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Multithreading Options on Apple Platforms</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/multithreading-options-on-apple-platforms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2021 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/multithreading-options-on-apple-platforms/</guid><description>&lt;p>We have reached the point in which computers are really fast. Especially Apple&amp;rsquo;s, as they have control of both the hardware and software, so, oftentimes, some tasks that could be sped up with multithreading, are not necessary anymore. But, for those cases when you do need multithreading, we have many options available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Apple&amp;rsquo;s platforms there is a surprising amount of concurrency tools. You are likely familiar with the most used one, the Grand Central Dispatch, &lt;code>DispatchQueue&lt;/code>, which is pretty good and it covers the vast majority of use cases. But there are some tasks that can be done easier with other tools.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Intercepting iOS Network Request Calls with Proxyman</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/intercepting-ios-network-request-calls-proxyman/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/intercepting-ios-network-request-calls-proxyman/</guid><description>&lt;p>Intercepting iOS Network Request Calls with Proxyman&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working with network APIs can be tricky, especially when debugging. You oftentimes have to ask yourself if your app is sending and receiving the expected information. You also often worry about whether the web service returns whatever it promises it will return. Working with APIs is both easy and tricky due to all the implications behind the scenes. What happens if the service goes down and sends unexpected responses? Or if your app loses internet connection? Using a proxy to intercept network calls will help us answer these questions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Being an iOS Developer in Bolivia (and South America)</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/being-ios-developer-bolivia/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2021 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/being-ios-developer-bolivia/</guid><description>&lt;p>Happy New Years everyone!

This time I want to focus on a topic that you won&amp;rsquo;t find in many other places, and that is what it is like to hunt for iOS jobs in Bolivia, and what my experience has been like being one here. By the end of this article, you will hopefully understand a very different market compared to countries such as the USA, and you will be able to make a decision on whether this is a field you want to pursue or not. What I&amp;rsquo;m going to be writing about applies to Bolivia, but keep in mind that South America in general has very similar conditions and markets.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quick Tip: Hosting JSON Files on Github for Free</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/quick-tip-hosting-json-files-github-for-free/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2020 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/quick-tip-hosting-json-files-github-for-free/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are times in which you may want to host small JSON (or other small types of files) somewhere because your app needs them. Maybe you want to configure feature flags, or maybe you want to host IAP identifiers somewhere so as to not hardcode them in your app. This last case is something I did recently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The immediate thought will be get a cheap server somewhere - after all, using something like &lt;a href="https://www.vultr.com/products/cloud-compute/#pricing">Vultr&lt;/a> you can get cheap hosting for as low as $2.50 per month. But did you know Github allows you to publish static websites, and you can piggyback that on that to store remote &amp;ldquo;config&amp;rdquo; about your apps?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Parsing Tricky JSON With Codable in Swift</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/parsing-tricky-json-codable-swift/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/parsing-tricky-json-codable-swift/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you have been writing Swift in the past couple of years, you have probably been using &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/codable">&lt;code>Codable&lt;/code>&lt;/a> (which is really just the composition of &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/decodable">&lt;code>Decodable&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/encodable">&lt;code>Encodable&lt;/code>&lt;/a> in the same protocol).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have been writing iOS apps for longer, you likely know about &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsonserialization">&lt;code>JSONSerialization&lt;/code>&lt;/a> as well, which is the backbone of &lt;code>Codable&lt;/code> and it allows you to do more manual work when parsing JSON, seemingly giving you more control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you know &lt;code>JSONSerialization&lt;/code>, you have probably found times in which Codable seemingly doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you the flexibility you need, and you may have been tempted to drop &lt;code>Codable&lt;/code> in favor of &lt;code>JSONSerialization&lt;/code> when parsing very specific or even corrupted JSON.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A More Practical Custom Formatter</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/a-more-practical-custom-formatter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2020 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/a-more-practical-custom-formatter/</guid><description>&lt;p>I had announced that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to write an article this week due to it being Elections Day in my country. that said I just can&amp;rsquo;t leave you guys without article, so this is a short one.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Anilist is the popular website for anime and manga fans, where you can keep track of your favorite series, or discover something new to watch or read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Silvianna comes packed with power features for list management. The app allows you to modify anything about items on your list as long as it is supported by Anilist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>FEATURES:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Friendly on the smallest iPhone and the biggest iPad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep track of series that are currently airing easily. Series that you haven&amp;rsquo;t watcheda all the episodes of and are currently airing will have a visible red banner telling you how many episodes behind you are, making it easy to keep track of everything you watch.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you finish watching a series, you will automatically be prompted for the rating. You no longer need to navigate through different screens if you weren&amp;rsquo;t able to rate something you watched.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When rating a series, it will use the rating system currently set in your Anilist account. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you are using the standard 10 point system, 10 point decimal system, 5-star system, or even the Emoji system - Silvianna supports all the rating systems provided by Anilist.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If your rating system supports Advanced Scoring, Silvianna will grab your parameters and you will be able to also perform advanced scoring according to your custom parameters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You have access to your Anilist profile, so you can access your Manga and Anime lists easily and quickly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Multiwindow support on the iPad.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can search the entire Anilist database for Anime and Manga.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is just the initial release of Silvianna, and we are excited to make the project grow with your feedback and ideas.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Writing Custom NSFormatters in Swift</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/writing-custom-nsformatters-swift/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/writing-custom-nsformatters-swift/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last year we explored &lt;a href="https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/nsformatter/">some NSFormatters and how to use them&lt;/a>.

Finally, a few weeks ago &lt;a href="https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/formatting-notes-and-gotchas/">we learned about yet more formatters, and how to better use the ones we already had&lt;/a>. In short, we have explored how powerful NSFormatter is. One thing we haven&amp;rsquo;t done yet though, is to write our own custom &lt;code>NSFormatter&lt;/code> subclass.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="nsformatter">NSFormatter&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;code>NSFormatter&lt;/code> is an abstract class. All formatter classes inherit from it.

&lt;p>&lt;code>NSFormatter&lt;/code> always does its best to format the data according to the user&amp;rsquo;s language and region where relevant. Apple is improving the combinations for this because it&amp;rsquo;s highly common for people to set their phones in a language that is not commonly used in a given region. This is pretty exciting for me, because I live in Bolivia where people speak Spanish, but I have used my devices in English for as long as I can remember.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Short Guide to Localization on Apple Platforms</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/a-short-guide-localization-apple-platforms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Sep 2020 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/a-short-guide-localization-apple-platforms/</guid><description>&lt;p>Translating our apps in different languages helps us reach wider audiences of different cultures.

As events, errors, or exceptional situations occur, a lot of software takes note of them using a local logging solution. This is done because these practices can allow us to troubleshoot problems for our users, find bugs, and in general understand the behavior of our software in untested or lesser tested scenarios.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When comes to iOS and other Apple platforms, there have always been third party dependencies that allow you to do this. A lot of developers roll their own solution and write events in plain text files. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until iOS 8 and macOS 10.10 that Apple provided us with a unified logging system that is easy to use and is very performant - &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/oslog">&lt;code>OSLog&lt;/code>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Simpler File Encryption on iOS</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/simpler-file-encryption-ios/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2020 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/simpler-file-encryption-ios/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not news that iOS has a heavy a focus on privacy and security. Apple provides us with many tools to make encryption easy, like &lt;a href="https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/common-cryptographic-operations-with-cryptokit/">CryptoKit&lt;/a>, a high-level Cryptography framework on iOS. When &lt;a href="https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/cryptokit-not-enough/">CryptoKit is not enough&lt;/a>, we can leverage older, lower-level APIs to do more cryptographic operations or use cyphers not covered by CryptoKit. We can even make use of &lt;a href="https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/cryptokit-secure-enclave/">the Secure Enclave&lt;/a> to leverage hardware-level security to our apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is all cool and dandy but did you know that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to leverage any of the technologies above to secure data in your app? In this article we will provide a much simpler method to protect user data, without having to know the first thing about Cryptography at all, and without compromising security at all. If you know you need to protect data, you can consider this option before even considering directly dealing with cryptography at all.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A File Download Queue in Combine for Swift</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/file-download-queue-combine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2020 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/file-download-queue-combine/</guid><description>&lt;p>Combine allows us to create pipelines for a lot of tasks.

Document scanning and text recognition are nothing new. But being able to have such a functionality in our pockets is pretty neat. These days we can create apps that have such features very quickly thanks to the push Apple has been doing to promote Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence on their devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Starting on iOS 11, we can natively scan documents with a system framework called VisionKit, and we can perform operations on images using a framework called Vision. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until iOS 13 that we finally had the ability to recognize text on images ourselves using the Vision framework, without leveraging third party libraries. In this article we will explore how we can use the VisionKit framework to scan documents and the Vision framework to detect text as two separate tasks, so you can see how easy these two tasks are and you can learn to put them together.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using the iOS Keychain with Biometrics</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/ios-keychain-touch-id-face-id/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/ios-keychain-touch-id-face-id/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you have been &lt;a href="https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/using-ios-keychain-swift/">using the keychain on your iOS apps&lt;/a> you may want to start using Face ID/Touch ID to let your user access your app and their data. This is a common use case but it&amp;rsquo;s very easy to do incorrectly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apple introduced Touch ID all the way back in 2013, and ever since then, every iOS device has come with some sort of biometric authentication method, be it Touch ID or Face ID. This has allowed developers to implement convenient unlocking into their apps to access sensitive data without having to ask for the passcode. If your app &amp;ldquo;locks&amp;rdquo; access in any way your users are probably expecting to &amp;ldquo;unlock&amp;rdquo; with their finger or Face ID, so it is your responsibility to implement in a way that is secure and can&amp;rsquo;t be vulnered.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using the iOS Keychain in Swift</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/using-ios-keychain-swift/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/using-ios-keychain-swift/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This article is an entirely rewritten version of an old tutorial I wrote years ago titled &amp;ldquo;Using the iOS Keychain&amp;rdquo;.

&lt;p>The Keychain is the place where you would store sensitive data.

This API, introduced in iOS 12, implements machine learning to work, and just like the other &lt;code>NaturalLanguage&lt;/code> classes, is very easy to use.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Recognizing the language in a Natural Language Text with NLanguageRecognizer</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/recognizing-language-nllanguagerecognizer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2020 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/recognizing-language-nllanguagerecognizer/</guid><description>&lt;p>Continuing my trend of writing about language processing, today I want to discuss about identifying the language of a body of text.

Starting on iOS 12, Apple has provided many APIs just for this task. In this article we will explore how to use &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage/nltokenizer">&lt;code>NLTokenizer&lt;/code>&lt;/a> to separate natural language text into its proper units.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="introduction-to-natural-language-tokenizing">Introduction to Natural Language Tokenizing&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you are not familiar with the inner workings of Natural Language processing, tokenizing simply means that we separate a string and analyze it to find its semantic units. If you are writing a program that processes text, you may be tempted to split the string using a separator. For example, if you wanted to get all the words in a natural sentence string in an array, you would write something like this:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Matching Natural Language Text for Predefined Data Patterns on Apple's Devices</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/matching-nl-nsdatadetector/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/matching-nl-nsdatadetector/</guid><description>&lt;p>iOS has a lot of APIs that deal with natural language detection. One such class is &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatadetector">&lt;code>NSDataDetector&lt;/code>&lt;/a>. This class allows you to match different kinds of data in text, including dates, time, links, and more. This class, actually introduced a very long time ago (in the iOS 4.0 days!) makes it very easy to find this kind of data in strings. In this article we will explore how to use this very old class - whose documentation is Objective-C only at this time - in Swift, and how to do common tasks with it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Recognizing Speech Locally on an iOS Device Using the Speech Framework</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/speech-recognition-sfspeechrecognizer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2020 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/speech-recognition-sfspeechrecognizer/</guid><description>&lt;p>As iOS becomes more advanced, features that we thought belonged to the long future start becoming more common place in today&amp;rsquo;s software. One such feature is speech recognition, which allows a device to take verbal input from a user, transcribe it into text, and do something with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In iOS, we can do this using a framework called &lt;code>Speech&lt;/code>, and an object called &lt;code>SFSpeechRecognizer&lt;/code>.

We saw how powerful and flexible that class is, letting us create different haptics for any context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes though, you want to play simpler haptics to let the user know that something has occurred. The &lt;code>CHHapticEngine&lt;/code> class can be overkill, and finding the right parameters to have interaction feedback can be very time consuming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a subclass of &lt;code>UIFeedbackGenerator&lt;/code> that actually exists since way before we got all the power &lt;code>CHHapticEngine&lt;/code>: &lt;code>UINotificationFeedbackGenerator&lt;/code> contains pre-made haptics to let users know when an action finished successfully, with an error, or a &amp;ldquo;warning&amp;rdquo; in the context of your app.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CryptoKit and the Secure Enclave</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/cryptokit-secure-enclave/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2020 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/cryptokit-secure-enclave/</guid><description>&lt;p>CryptoKit and the Secure Enclave&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apple&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/common-cryptographic-operations-with-cryptokit/">CryptoKit&lt;/a> introduced this year is full of amazing features. Not only does it offer very easy to use cryptography, but it also offers an interface to a security feature that Apple introduced less than a decade ago: The Secure Enclave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Secure Enclave is a hardware feature for helping the system work with cryptographically secure data. In this article, we will build upon our previous CryptoKit knowledge (see the article linked above), and we will also learn what the Secure Enclave is all about.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Implementing Parametrizable Shortcut Actions for your iOS Apps</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/parametrized-shortcuts/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2020 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/parametrized-shortcuts/</guid><description>&lt;p>All the way back to 2016, a group of very talented iOS developers released &lt;a href="workflow.is">Workflow&lt;/a>, a very popular app to let users create actions of different kinds within the system&amp;rsquo;s constraints. You could create and automate different tasks, such as controlling a server via SSH, downloading all the images from a website, and more&amp;hellip; Much, much more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apple saw the power of the app and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone/">acquired&lt;/a> it in March 2017. This was very exciting, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t hear anything from the app since. Until WWDC 2018. Apple revealed a new app: Shortcuts. This app was built on top of Workflow, and as an Apple app, it allowed it to do many things that Workflow just wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed to do, such as toggling system settings, integrating it with other apps (!!), and it was also natively integrated into Siri.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AIiCloudSync</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/aiicloudsync/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 17:27:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/aiicloudsync/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/AndyIbanez/AIiCloudSync">GitHub Repository&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="aiicloudsync">AIiCloudSync&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>AIiCloudSync is a simple Package written in Swift to synchronize specific UserDefaults with the iCloud Key Value store (&lt;code>NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To use this package, create a single instance of &lt;code>AIiCloudSync&lt;/code>, and keep a reference to it. Once you create it, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about it any longer. It will automatically sync changes between iCloud and your local UserDefaults through the lifetime of your application. You can optionally receive notifications when the iCloud Syncs change so you can react accordingly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Modern Backgrounds Tasks in iOS 13</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/modern-background-tasks-ios13/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2019 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/modern-background-tasks-ios13/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the &lt;a href="https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/background-execution-in-ios/">article from last week&lt;/a>, we explored the basic background execution APIs introduced since iOS 7. We explored how we could request additional time for a task to complete after entering the background, how we could defer downloads with URLSession, and how we could use silent push notifications to trigger background tasks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The story with background tasks does not end there. iOS 13 introduced more APIs to do better background tasks, and that allow you to do things that weren&amp;rsquo;t possible before. Apple gave us the new shiny &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks">&lt;code>BackgroundTasks&lt;/code>&lt;/a> framework on WWDC2019. This framework gives developers more flexibility and less constraints to execute code while their apps are in the background. Not only that, but the old Background App Refresh APIs have now been deprecated in favor of a new, modern way to perform them for your app. This changes unifies with the new Background Processing tasks which lets you do more work in the background, while a device is charging, and more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Background Execution on iOS</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/background-execution-in-ios/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/background-execution-in-ios/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the early days of iOS development, developers had no way at all to perform background tasks beyond a very limited constraints of tasks, like music playback. Modern demands go beyond allowing people to play music in your app while they use a different app, and we as developers need to adapt to these changes. VoIP, lengthy networking, and even silent pushes to keep an app updated are very common these days, and fulfilling these demands used to be hard, if not outright impossible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Formatting Relative Dates With RelativeDateTimeFormatter</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/formatting-relative-dates-relativedatetimeformatter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2019 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/formatting-relative-dates-relativedatetimeformatter/</guid><description>&lt;p>Formatting Relative Dates With RelativeDateTimeFormatter&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few weeks ago we talked about &lt;a href="https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/nsformatter/">formatting content with NSFormatter&lt;/a>, an abstract class from which multiple formatting classes inherit from to allow you to format different kinds of data in a human-readable form. &lt;code>NSFormatter&lt;/code> is not only a class you can inherit from yourself, but as iOS evolves, more formatters will be added to its family.

**Important Note**
&lt;p>Soon after I published this article, Christian Tietze wrote a fair criticism of this idea &lt;a href="https://christiantietze.de/posts/2019/12/userdefaults-property-wrappers/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you understand how property wrappers work, you can use this article to apply it to user defaults. The main idea is that property wrappers allow you to store your values differently and even externally. That said, you may or may not want to implement this in a real app. I recommend you read this article first, and then go back to Christian&amp;rsquo;s to see more downsides of this idea other than the ones I mentioned below.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Intercepting Network Traffic with mitmproxy</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/intercepting-network-mitmproxy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Nov 2019 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/intercepting-network-mitmproxy/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you have been programming mobile apps for a while, you must have used a web based API - JSON based or otherwise - and you have had to deal with bugs related to your requests and responses to a web service.

One such feature is Pattern Matching, and it allows you to write some cleaner code when dealing with some operations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, consider casting. Casting is a feature in the vast majority of statically-typed languages. Casting is considered to be an ugly operation by some, because when you need to cast, it&amp;rsquo;s usually because the language has a flaw that prevents it from telling you about the right data type underneath. This is specially true when you add in Object-Oriented Programming and classes are marked to return a super type instead of a specific subtype. With pattern matching, you can more cleanly check for datatypes without having to worry about crashes or weird behavior.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding and Implementing NSNotificationCenter on Apple's Platforms</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/nsnotificationcenter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2019 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/nsnotificationcenter/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sometimes when you are writing an app, you need to be notified of events occurring somewhere else in the system - either in your own app, or in the operating system - and react to them accordingly. For example, you may be an app like Snapchat and you want to know when a screenshot has been taken. This is a system notification that you can &amp;ldquo;listen&amp;rdquo; to in order to react.

&lt;p>Apple providing new cryptography tools is nothing new.

&lt;p>First being introduced in the Apple Watch, Haptic Feedback has been a core part of the Apple ecosystem experience since. Just think about it, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be weird if you force-touched the screen to do something, and there was no physical response from the device? Think of the old Peek-and-Pop.

&lt;p>A &lt;code>Result&lt;/code> wraps a success or a failure. It is essentially an &lt;code>enum&lt;/code> with two possible cases: &lt;code>.success&lt;/code> and &lt;code>.failure&lt;/code>. The &lt;code>.success&lt;/code> case wraps the correct result of an operation, whereas a &lt;code>.failure&lt;/code> wraps an &lt;code>Error&lt;/code>.

&lt;p>&lt;em>Discontinued project, but a new version is in the works. Developed in 2014.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mignori is a mobile client to use with -booru or -booru based sites (Gelbooru and Danbooru, to name a few).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A -booru imageboard is simply a board where people post pictures and tag with them relevant attributes. This allows other users to search for images in these boards and find images with the qualities they’re looking for.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cecrecy</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/cecrecy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2014 22:07:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/cecrecy/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.andyibanez.com/img/cecrecy.png" alt="Cecrecy">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you want to protect app data from your friends or family that are constantly asking for your iDevice, there are a couple of things you can do: You can tell them not to enter certain apps, empowering their curiosity and therefore exposing your private data, or you can passcode-lock certain apps, which if they see, they will just wonder what you’re hiding that they can’t see.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Maulencer</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/maulencer/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2014 21:58:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/maulencer/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.andyibanez.com/img/maulencer.png" alt="Maulencer">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Discontinued project. Developed in 2013.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A friend of mine had his hardware ringer of his phone die on him. Because of that, toggling the ringer on and off was quite a chore for him. Without installing SBSettings or anything equivalent to that, he had to go to the settings app and toggle the ringer on and off there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So he asked me to write an icon on SpringBoard that would toggle the ringer. And here it is. It’s a really, really simple tweak. In developer circles it probably isn’t worth anyone’s time. But anyway, I decided to release to the public and here it is.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sideswitch Toggles</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/sideswitch-toggles/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2014 21:46:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/sideswitch-toggles/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.andyibanez.com/img/sideswitch-toggles.png" alt="Sideswitch Toggles">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Discontinued project. Developed in 2012.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sideswitch Toggles is a MobileSubstrate tweak that gives you full control over your iPhone’s Ringer (and as such, it isn’t available for the iPod Touch). The tweak simply modifies the action that happens when you toggle the ringer on and off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By default, Sideswitch Toggles comes with the ability to toggle Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Airplane Mode, and Do Not Disturb. The capabilities of Sideswitch can be easily extended by other developers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Silight</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/silight/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2014 21:39:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/silight/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.andyibanez.com/img/silight.png" alt="SiLight">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>SiLight is a small AssistantExtension that allows Siri to turn on your phone’s torch to use it as a flashlight. SiLight is a real quick flashlight, since commands work in the Lockscreen too. SiLight was programmed having natural speech in mind, instead of talking to her like a robot (“flashlight on”) you can ask her as you would ask anyone (“I need a flashlight”, “Siri, there’s a blackout”). It also features some hidden surprises for geeks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Combox</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/combox/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2014 18:54:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/combox/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.andyibanez.com/img/combox.png" alt="Combox">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Combox is a third-party client for Dropbox.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do you love Dropbox? Dropbox is a very nifty service that allows you to store your files in the cloud. With Dropbox, you can upload and download your documents and photos anywhere, any time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why a third-party client? This app was made with Dropbox lovers and Power Users in mind. It offers many features that no other Dropbox clients for iOS offer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SBConverter</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/sb-converter/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2014 18:25:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/sb-converter/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://www.andyibanez.com/img/sb-converter.png" alt="SB Converter">&lt;/p>
