The tweak simply modifies the action that happens when you toggle the ringer on and off.</p><p>By default, Sideswitch Toggles comes with the ability to toggle Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Airplane Mode, and Do Not Disturb. The capabilities of Sideswitch can be easily extended by other developers.</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/silight/>Silight</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on

Developed in 2011</em></p><p>SiLight is a small AssistantExtension that allows Siri to turn on your phone’s torch to use it as a flashlight. SiLight is a real quick flashlight, since commands work in the Lockscreen too. SiLight was programmed having natural speech in mind, instead of talking to her like a robot (“flashlight on”) you can ask her as you would ask anyone (“I need a flashlight”, “Siri, there’s a blackout”). It also features some hidden surprises for geeks.</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/combox/>Combox</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on
