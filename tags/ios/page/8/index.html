<time class=post-date datetime=2019-09-18T07:00:00-04:00>September 18, 2019</time></p><p>On WWDC2019, Apple decided to fork iOS into two different operating systems: iOS for iPhones, and iPadOS for iPads. This is to recognize the iPad as its own independent entity that has its own set of features compared to iOS. Amongst those features, iPadOS adds Multiwindow support, which allows our apps to run in more than one Window at the same time.</p><h1 id=what-exactly-is-multi-window-support-and-how-does-it-work>What exactly is Multi-window support, and how does it work?</h1><p>iOS 9 introduced the Slide Over and Split Screen features for iPad, which allowed us to run two different apps side by side at the same time. Multi-window support on iPadOS allows you to do this with two windows of your own app, and more.</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/swift-result-type/>Understanding the Result Type in Swift</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on
<time class=post-date datetime=2019-09-11T07:00:00-04:00>September 11, 2019</time></p><p>Error handling when expecting a result out of an operation is a very common thing to do. For this reason, various high-level programming languages have introduced a <code>Result</code> type into their libraries, on top of their existing error-handling features. This feature was implemented in Swift 5.</p><p>A <code>Result</code> wraps a success or a failure. It is essentially an <code>enum</code> with two possible cases: <code>.success</code> and <code>.failure</code>. The <code>.success</code> case wraps the correct result of an operation, whereas a <code>.failure</code> wraps an <code>Error</code>. Its implementation uses generics, so you always know what you are going to get back.</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/building-urls-with-nsurlcomponents/>Building URLs With NSURLComponents</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on

Depending on our needs, we may need to cache data on disk and manually manage it ourselves, or we may only need it to cache it in memory. In the case of the latter, Apple offers <code>NSCache</code>, a mutable collection that lets us cache files in memory using key-value pairs.</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/exploring-the-nsoperation-apis/>Exploring the NSOperation APIs for Apple's Platforms</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on
