&lt;p>A few weeks ago, I sold and transferred my app, &lt;a href="https://www.andyibanez.com/projects/nextanimeepisode1/">Next Anime Episode&lt;/a>, to another developer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, I will discuss the reasons I transferred my app, and what I learned along the way in the process of transferring it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As a developer who works a full time job and work on indie apps as a hobby, there are many ideas I want to work on. Having apps on the App Store is actually a really big responsibility. You have to maintain it and add features at least every so often to it in order to keep interested. If the app becomes popular enough, the pressure just grows, because you have to start dealing with negative reviews of all kinds. Sometimes justified, sometimes people don&amp;rsquo;t understand the purpose of your app, sometimes they just insult it and give no feedback whatsoever to improve it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
