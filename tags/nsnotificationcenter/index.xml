For example, you may be an app like Snapchat and you want to know when a screenshot has been taken. This is a system notification that you can &amp;ldquo;listen&amp;rdquo; to in order to react. If you have an app like a photo gallery, you may need to know when the user adds a new photo so you can update all relevant UI and make other necessary updates.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
