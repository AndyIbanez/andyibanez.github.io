For this reason, various high-level programming languages have introduced a <code>Result</code> type into their libraries, on top of their existing error-handling features. This feature was implemented in Swift 5.</p><p>A <code>Result</code> wraps a success or a failure. It is essentially an <code>enum</code> with two possible cases: <code>.success</code> and <code>.failure</code>. The <code>.success</code> case wraps the correct result of an operation, whereas a <code>.failure</code> wraps an <code>Error</code>. Its implementation uses generics, so you always know what you are going to get back.</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/building-urls-with-nsurlcomponents/>Building URLs With NSURLComponents</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on

Depending on our needs, we may need to cache data on disk and manually manage it ourselves, or we may only need it to cache it in memory. In the case of the latter, Apple offers <code>NSCache</code>, a mutable collection that lets us cache files in memory using key-value pairs.</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/exploring-the-nsoperation-apis/>Exploring the NSOperation APIs for Apple's Platforms</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on
