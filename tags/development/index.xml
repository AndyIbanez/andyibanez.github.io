To kick off this year, I wanted to write a non-technical article. This time I want to focus on a topic that you won&amp;rsquo;t find in many other places, and that is what it is like to hunt for iOS jobs in Bolivia, and what my experience has been like being one here. By the end of this article, you will hopefully understand a very different market compared to countries such as the USA, and you will be able to make a decision on whether this is a field you want to pursue or not. What I&amp;rsquo;m going to be writing about applies to Bolivia, but keep in mind that South America in general has very similar conditions and markets.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
