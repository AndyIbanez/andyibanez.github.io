The original article was written in February 2017 for a much older version of rclone. This revised article covers rclone 1.48, and it has been rewritten from scratch to improve its quality. The examples used in the original article have been kept.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://rclone.org/">&lt;code>rclone&lt;/code>&lt;/a> is a command line tool, similar to &lt;a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync">&lt;code>rsync&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, with the difference that it can sync, move, copy, and in general do other file operations on cloud storage services, such as Dropbox and Google Drive. You can use &lt;code>rclone&lt;/code> to create backups of your servers or personal computers or to simply store your files in the cloud, optionally adding encryption.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
