This week we will continue exploring more natural language APIs provided by the <code>NaturalLanguage</code> framework. We will learn about the <a href=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage/nltagger>NLTagger</a> class, which allows us to to analyze natural language text to find parts of speech, lexical classes, lemma, scripts, and more. This API, introduced in iOS 12, implements machine learning to work, and just like the other <code>NaturalLanguage</code> classes, is very easy to use.</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/recognizing-language-nllanguagerecognizer/>Recognizing the language in a Natural Language Text with NLanguageRecognizer</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on

This is an interesting task we can do thanks, once again, to Apple&rsquo;s investment in APIs linked to machine learning.</p><p>Today we will explore the <a href=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage/nllanguagerecognizer><code>NLLanguageRecognizer</code></a> object. Introduced in iOS 12, this class can do a lot of language recognizing, from detecting the &ldquo;dominant language&rdquo; of a string, to all the possible languages.</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/tokenizing-nltokenizer/>Tokenizing Natural Language into Semantic Units in iOS</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on

Starting on iOS 12, Apple has provided many APIs just for this task. In this article we will explore how to use <a href=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage/nltokenizer><code>NLTokenizer</code></a> to separate natural language text into its proper units.</p><h1 id=introduction-to-natural-language-tokenizing>Introduction to Natural Language Tokenizing</h1><p>If you are not familiar with the inner workings of Natural Language processing, tokenizing simply means that we separate a string and analyze it to find its semantic units. If you are writing a program that processes text, you may be tempted to split the string using a separator. For example, if you wanted to get all the words in a natural sentence string in an array, you would write something like this:</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/matching-nl-nsdatadetector/>Matching Natural Language Text for Predefined Data Patterns on Apple's Devices</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on
<time class=post-date datetime=2020-02-05T07:00:00-04:00>February 5, 2020</time></p><p>iOS has a lot of APIs that deal with natural language detection. One such class is <a href=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsdatadetector><code>NSDataDetector</code></a>. This class allows you to match different kinds of data in text, including dates, time, links, and more. This class, actually introduced a very long time ago (in the iOS 4.0 days!) makes it very easy to find this kind of data in strings. In this article we will explore how to use this very old class - whose documentation is Objective-C only at this time - in Swift, and how to do common tasks with it.</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/haptics-with-uinotificationfeedbackgenerator/>Generating Feedback Haptics with UINotificationFeedbackGenerator</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on

We saw how powerful and flexible that class is, letting us create different haptics for any context.</p><p>Sometimes though, you want to play simpler haptics to let the user know that something has occurred. The <code>CHHapticEngine</code> class can be overkill, and finding the right parameters to have interaction feedback can be very time consuming.</p><p>There is a subclass of <code>UIFeedbackGenerator</code> that actually exists since way before we got all the power <code>CHHapticEngine</code>: <code>UINotificationFeedbackGenerator</code> contains pre-made haptics to let users know when an action finished successfully, with an error, or a &ldquo;warning&rdquo; in the context of your app.</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/cryptokit-secure-enclave/>CryptoKit and the Secure Enclave</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on

We explored how we could request additional time for a task to complete after entering the background, how we could defer downloads with URLSession, and how we could use silent push notifications to trigger background tasks.</p><p>The story with background tasks does not end there. iOS 13 introduced more APIs to do better background tasks, and that allow you to do things that weren&rsquo;t possible before. Apple gave us the new shiny <a href=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks><code>BackgroundTasks</code></a> framework on WWDC2019. This framework gives developers more flexibility and less constraints to execute code while their apps are in the background. Not only that, but the old Background App Refresh APIs have now been deprecated in favor of a new, modern way to perform them for your app. This changes unifies with the new Background Processing tasks which lets you do more work in the background, while a device is charging, and more.</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/formatting-relative-dates-relativedatetimeformatter/>Formatting Relative Dates With RelativeDateTimeFormatter</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on

The main idea is that property wrappers allow you to store your values differently and even externally. That said, you may or may not want to implement this in a real app. I recommend you read this article first, and then go back to Christian&rsquo;s to see more downsides of this idea other than the ones I mentioned below.</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/intercepting-network-mitmproxy/>Intercepting Network Traffic with mitmproxy</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on
<time class=post-date datetime=2019-11-20T07:00:00-04:00>November 20, 2019</time></p><p>If you have been programming mobile apps for a while, you must have used a web based API - JSON based or otherwise - and you have had to deal with bugs related to your requests and responses to a web service. You have likely asked yourself why some parsing code is not working as expected, or why a request seems to have an invalid format. Intercepting your own network calls with a proxy can help you find the answer to these questions.</p></article><hr><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class=page-item><a href=/tags/macos/ aria-label=First class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/tags/macos/page/3/ aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/tags/macos/page/2/ aria-label="Page 2" class=page-link role=button>2</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/tags/macos/page/3/ aria-label="Page 3" class=page-link role=button>3</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 4" class=page-link role=button>4</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/tags/macos/page/5/ aria-label="Page 5" class=page-link role=button>5</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/tags/macos/page/6/ aria-label="Page 6" class=page-link role=button>6</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/tags/macos/page/5/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/tags/macos/page/6/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></div></main><footer><div class=container><div class=footer-navigation><a href=https://github.com/AndyIbanez><span class=inline-svg><svg viewBox="0 0 42 40" id="svg4" width="42" height="40"><path fill="currentColor" d="m14.20936 32.20794c0 .16542-.19024.29776-.4301.29776-.27295.0248-.46319-.10752-.46319-.29776.0-.16542.19024-.29776.4301-.29776.24814-.0248.46319.10752.46319.29776zm-2.57234-.3722c-.0579.16542.10753.35566.35566.40528.21505.0827.46319.0.51282-.16542.0496-.16542-.10753-.35566-.35566-.4301-.21505-.0579-.45492.0248-.51282.19024zm3.65586-.14061c-.23986.0579-.40529.21505-.38047.40528.0248.16543.23986.27295.488.21505.23986-.0579.40528-.21505.38047-.38047-.0248-.15715-.24813-.26468-.488-.23986zM20.73531-.19734273e-6C9.2632-.19734273e-6.48748 8.7095398.48748 20.18166c0 9.17273 5.77328 17.02207 14.01964 19.78464 1.05871.19024 1.43091-.46319 1.43091-1.00081.0-.51282-.0248-3.34156-.0248-5.0785.0.0-5.78982 1.24067-7.00568-2.46481.0.0-.94292-2.40691-2.29939-3.02725.0.0-1.8941-1.29857.13234-1.27376.0.0 2.05952.16542 3.19267 2.13396 1.81139 3.19267 4.84691 2.27457 6.02969 1.72868.19023-1.32339.72786-2.24149 1.32338-2.78739-4.62358-.51281-9.28852-1.18278-9.28852-9.13964.0-2.27458.62861-3.416 1.95199-4.87172-.21505-.53763-.9181-2.7543.21506-5.6161302 1.72867-.53762 5.7071 2.2332202 5.7071 2.2332202 1.65424-.46319 3.43254-.70305 5.1943-.70305 1.76176.0 3.54006.23986 5.1943.70305.0.0 3.97843-2.7791202 5.7071-2.2332202 1.13315 2.8701002.4301 5.0785002.21505 5.6161302 1.32339 1.46399 2.13397 2.60542 2.13397 4.87172.0 7.98168-4.87172 8.61856-9.49531 9.13964.76095.65342 1.4061 1.8941 1.4061 3.83782.0 2.78739-.0248 6.23647-.0248 6.9147.0.53763.38047 1.19105 1.43091 1.00082 8.27117-2.74603 13.87903-10.59537 13.87903-19.7681C41.51252 8.7095398 32.20745-.19734273e-6 20.73533-.19734273e-6zM8.52706 28.52727c-.10752.0827-.0827.27295.0579.4301.13234.13234.32258.19024.4301.0827.10753-.0827.0827-.27295-.0579-.4301-.13233-.13234-.32257-.19024-.4301-.0827zM7.63378 27.8573c-.0579.10753.0248.23987.19023.32258.13234.0827.29777.0579.35566-.0579C8.23757 28.01446 8.15487 27.88212 7.98944 27.7994 7.82401 27.7498 7.69168 27.7746 7.63378 27.8573zm2.67986 2.94454c-.13234.10753-.0827.35566.10752.51281.19024.19024.4301.21505.53763.0827.10752-.10752.0579-.35566-.10753-.51281-.18196-.19024-.4301-.21505-.53762-.0827zM9.37072 29.58598c-.13234.0827-.13234.29776.0.488.13234.19023.35566.27295.46319.19023.13234-.10752.13234-.32257.0-.51281-.1158-.19024-.33085-.27295-.46319-.16542z" id="path2" style="stroke-width:.08271171"/></svg>
