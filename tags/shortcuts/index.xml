You could create and automate different tasks, such as controlling a server via SSH, downloading all the images from a website, and more&amp;hellip; Much, much more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apple saw the power of the app and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone/">acquired&lt;/a> it in March 2017. This was very exciting, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t hear anything from the app since. Until WWDC 2018. Apple revealed a new app: Shortcuts. This app was built on top of Workflow, and as an Apple app, it allowed it to do many things that Workflow just wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed to do, such as toggling system settings, integrating it with other apps (!!), and it was also natively integrated into Siri.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
