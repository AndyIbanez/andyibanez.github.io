In this article, we will explore what&amp;rsquo;s new with &lt;code>UIDatePicker&lt;/code> on iOS, an API that has existed since the dawn of time and hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed much since its introduction.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="a-short-history-on-pickers">A Short History on Pickers&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>&lt;code>UIDatePicker&lt;/code> is an API that has existed since the very early days of the iOS SDK - it goes all the way back to iOS 2.0.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Search APIs in iOS 13</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/ios13-new-search-apis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Nov 2019 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/ios13-new-search-apis/</guid><description>&lt;p>iOS has always provided interesting search APIs, but they have always been limited and doing the most interesting tasks required you to either write your own implementation or use private APIs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have been using &lt;code>UISearchController&lt;/code> and &lt;code>UISearchBar&lt;/code> for a &lt;em>very&lt;/em> long time, and I have always found it bizarre that Apple didn&amp;rsquo;t expose its underlying text field property. As of iOS 13, the search bar finally exposes it, in the form of a &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uisearchtextfield">&lt;code>UISearchTextField&lt;/code>&lt;/a> object.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
