It has become a pretty popular language for a vast array of domains. For this reason, making languages interoperate with it is pretty important, and both Swift and Objective-C are no exception. We can work with JavaScript, not only by executing JavaScript code directly from our Swift code, but we can even expose code from Swift and Objective-C to JavaScript. That&rsquo;s how important this language is, and these features open a world of possibilities.</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/xcode-new-file-templates/>Xcode New File Templates</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on

But, for those cases when you do need multithreading, we have many options available.</p><p>On Apple&rsquo;s platforms there is a surprising amount of concurrency tools.

I have been studying iOS development for a long time with many resources, and none of the resources ever dive into useful data structures, such as <em>sets</em>. These sources tend to focus on arrays and dictionaries only (as the focus is iOS development, and not necessarily computer science), not teaching other structures that are actually really useful in the iOS Development world.
