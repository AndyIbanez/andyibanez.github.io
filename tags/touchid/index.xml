&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s remember that SwiftUI uses the MVVM design pattern over the traditional MVC, and this can be confusing for people who are migrating to the new pattern for the first time. That said, the main takeaway from this article is to understand that views get destroyed and rebuilt &lt;em>very&lt;/em> often in SwiftUI, and therefore the right place to write this kind of logic is in the &lt;code>ViewModel&lt;/code>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
