This feature allows us to inspect and work with the members of a type.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if this doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense, suppose you wanted to check &lt;em>what&lt;/em> members a type has. How would you do this? Ideally you&amp;rsquo;d like to iterate over its members and print them. This is a very basic application of Reflection, but it should let think of other potential uses for it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding @dynamicMemberLookup and @dynamicCallable in Swift</title><link>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/understanding-dynamicmemberlookup-dynamiccallable-swift/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2020 07:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/understanding-dynamicmemberlookup-dynamiccallable-swift/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you have written code in a programming language such as Python or PHP, you can find many direct comparisons to Swift. For one, Swift is statically typed, whereas PHP and Python are not - Swift is considered a safe language as it has a bunch of features to protect you against mistakes - static typing, error throwing, optionality for dealing with nulls, to name a few -, whereas PHP and Python do not.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
