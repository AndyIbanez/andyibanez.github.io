As events, errors, or exceptional situations occur, a lot of software takes note of them using a local logging solution. This is done because these practices can allow us to troubleshoot problems for our users, find bugs, and in general understand the behavior of our software in untested or lesser tested scenarios.</p><p>When comes to iOS and other Apple platforms, there have always been third party dependencies that allow you to do this. A lot of developers roll their own solution and write events in plain text files. It wasn&rsquo;t until iOS 8 and macOS 10.10 that Apple provided us with a unified logging system that is easy to use and is very performant - <a href=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/oslog><code>OSLog</code></a>.</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/simpler-file-encryption-ios/>Simpler File Encryption on iOS</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on

Apple provides us with many tools to make encryption easy, like <a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/common-cryptographic-operations-with-cryptokit/>CryptoKit</a>, a high-level Cryptography framework on iOS. When <a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/cryptokit-not-enough/>CryptoKit is not enough</a>, we can leverage older, lower-level APIs to do more cryptographic operations or use cyphers not covered by CryptoKit. We can even make use of <a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/cryptokit-secure-enclave/>the Secure Enclave</a> to leverage hardware-level security to our apps.</p><p>This is all cool and dandy but did you know that you don&rsquo;t need to leverage any of the technologies above to secure data in your app? In this article we will provide a much simpler method to protect user data, without having to know the first thing about Cryptography at all, and without compromising security at all. If you know you need to protect data, you can consider this option before even considering directly dealing with cryptography at all.</p></article><hr><article><h2 class=title><a href=https://www.andyibanez.com/posts/andyibanez-com-turns-one-year-old/>andyibanez.com Turns One Year Old</a></h2><p class=publish>Published on
